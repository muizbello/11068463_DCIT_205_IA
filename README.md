### Project Description
This project is designed in line with the requirements for the Interim Assessment for DCIT 205. It is my reimagined version of the Computer Science Department's website. 
It was developed using;

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript

## Project Structure
The components of the webpages are split into four folders;
* Webpages(Contains the HTML files).
* CSS_Files(Contains the CSS files).
* Javascript_Files(Contains the javascript files).
* Media_Files(Contains the media files used).

It is made up 10 webpages namely;
1. [Homepage](#homepage)
2. [Admissions](#admissions)
3. [Undergraduate Program](#undergraduate-programs)
4. [Postgraduate Program](#postgraduate-programs)
5. [Contact Us](#contact-us)
6. [About](#about)
7. [Faculty](#faculty)
8. [Facilities](#facilities)
9. [Entry Requirements](#entry-requirements)
10. [Student's Organisation](#compssa)

There are two CSS files; one to style the homepage and the other to style the other 9 webpages.<br>
There is one Javascript file, this handles the slideshow functionality of in the homepage.

## Getting Started
Follow these guidelines to remotely setup this project.
### Prerequisites
The HTML, CSS, and Javascript components of each webpage require a local web browser to render said components correctly. However, in the situation that a user wants to run the javascript file independently, node js needs to be installed. It can be downloaded from [the official node website](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

### Learning Take-aways from the project
Through this project; 
* I was introduced to the concept of nested tag targeting without setting id's or classes.
* I also found out about the capabilities of CSS to manipiulate the "reactivity" of a webpage as opposed to being regulated to only styling.
* I was introduced to the markdown syntax used for readme.md files.
